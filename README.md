# Embedded Resources

The aim of this repository is to collect all the cool and useful stuff I've come across on the internet related to embedded systems. 

## Roadmaps/Compilations:

## Forums

Forums are a great resource to get information from people in the industry. The information is disorganized, but the tradeoff is that it's the most "up to date" information in the industry compared to textbooks, courses and things that people have had time to organize. Here are two that I frequent (some of the links that follow are from these websites):

## Interview Prep

Crushing the Firmware & Embedded Systems Interview | Medium
Cracking the (embedded) Coding Interview - Manasi Rajan (embeddedrelated.com)
A summary: how to use bit manipulation to solve problems easily and efficiently | LeetCode
A ‘C’ Test: The 0x10 Best Questions for Would-be Embedded Programmers | RMB Consulting

## Tutorials

A very well-written introduction to microcontrollers. Covers all the core things you need to know and reads like a story. There are 14 parts, all are top tier content.
Introduction to Microcontrollers - Beginnings - Mike Silva (embeddedrelated.com)
Important Programming Concepts (Even on Embedded Systems) Part I: Idempotence - Jason Sachs (embeddedrelated.com)

Some important CIS concepts that are especially relevant to embedded software. This is part 1 of 5, the whole series is worth a read
Information on the volatile keyword, which I've been asked about in about 70% of all my embedded interviews (and something I've asked when I was on the other side of the table)
The volatile keyword - Colin Walls (embeddedrelated.com)
This is a great guide to implementing FSMs. Many embedded systems and processes are modelled as FSMs, and I haven't come across many good resources that talk about how you'd actually turn it into code.
Implementing State Machines - Stephen Friederichs (embeddedrelated.com)
Small or fast? - Colin Walls (embeddedrelated.com). This article tells you something that every embedded developer always thinks about. It doesn't contain too much information by itself - but the reason I'm sharing it is because it shows up again and again. This is the "resolution" at which you want to think about embedded code when you're actually working, or a "lens through which to look at code" that matters to embedded devices.
Here's an example of the concept:  ++i and i++ : what’s the difference? - Colin Walls (embeddedrelated.com)
