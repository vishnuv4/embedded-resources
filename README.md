# Embedded Resources

The aim of this repository is to collect all the cool stuff I've come across on the internet related to embedded systems. I like reading and I like embedded systems, so it makes sense that I would maintain a repository of reading material related to embedded systems.

## Roadmaps/Compilations:

- [m3y54m's Embedded Engineering Roadmap](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [Embedded Systems Roadmaps - Nathan Jones](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1589.php)
- [So You Want To Be An Embedded Systems Developer - Steve Branam](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1324.php)
- [Skills For Embedded Systems Software Developers - Steve Branam](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1460.php)
- [A skills tree by Elecia White](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/50834ba9c4aa1a31c651078b/t/65282cd79af38b46be8da4db/1697131736219/20231012_Embedded_Systems_Skill_Tree.pdf)

## Forums and Blogs

Forums are a great resource to get information from people in the industry. The information may be a bit disorganized, but the tradeoff is that it's the most "up to date" information in the industry compared to textbooks, courses and things that people have had time to organize.

## Tutorials

- [Introduction to Microcontrollers](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/453.php)
    - A very well-written introduction to microcontrollers written by Mike Silva. Covers many core ideas, and reads like a story. There are 14 parts, and all are worth a read.
- [Important Programming Concepts](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/629.php)
    - These are all CS topics that are arguably more important for embedded devices compared to laptops or more powerful compute machines.

## Miscellaneous

- [Information on the volatile keyword](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1650.php)
- [A guide on coding Finite State Machines](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/543.php)
    - Here's another nice one: [How to code a state machine on C or C++](https://barrgroup.com/blog/how-code-state-machine-c-or-c)
- [An important idea in embedded systems](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1690.php)
    - The article itself doesn't have much information - but it conveys a lens through which to look at code that's very important to embedded firmware.
    - For example: [++i and i++ : what’s the difference?](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1629.php)
